# Frontend Testing Workshop - Code Examples

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/a557913c563a42a3a6ed731f6b56bf1e)](https://www.codacy.com/app/diemol_3/frontend_testing?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=diemol/frontend_testing&utm_campaign=badger)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/diemol/frontend_testing.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/diemol/frontend_testing)

This repository contains different examples that are used during a basic Frontend Testing workshop.

The code was written in general in a simple way, without any frameworks or external tools that could hide the basic
steps to develop tests with Selenium WebDriver.

The main idea of the code is to show how tests can be written from scratch, but it is clear that different frameworks
could be used to simplify the code and provide helper functions. Nevertheless, the intention is to keep it basic and
simple.

The examples are provided in Java with TestNG and JavaScript with Mocha + Chai.

## The code is structured as follows:
* [first-test](https://github.com/diemol/frontend_testing/tree/master/first-test)

    A page is opened, the page title is retrieved, and finally an assertion of a expected value is done.
* [add-item-to-shopping-cart](https://github.com/diemol/frontend_testing/tree/master/add-item-to-shopping-cart)

    This is an example where a guest searches for a brand and puts an item in the shopping cart.
* [running-in-parallel](https://github.com/diemol/frontend_testing/tree/master/running-in-parallel)

    After having tests working, a natural step is to try to execute all of them in less time. Some simple examples where a page is loaded are executed in parallel.
* [page-objects](https://github.com/diemol/frontend_testing/tree/master/page-objects)

    A final round up of the hotel booking example but now using the Page Object model/pattern, which is know as one of the best practices when doing Frontend Testing.


## General Setup to run the examples

### Java
_Only if you want to run the Java examples_
* [Install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* Or Install Maven with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

    ```sh
    brew install maven
    ```

### JavaScript
_Only if you want to run the JavaScript examples_
* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Or Install Node.js with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

    ```sh
    brew install node
    ```

### Docker
[Zalenium](https://github.com/zalando/zalenium) is used to run most of the examples.
This means:
* You need to have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, version >= 1.11.1. Here are the instructions for 
most of the supported [platforms](https://www.docker.com/products/docker).
* After installing docker, just run this command to start Zalenium:

  ```sh
  curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dosel/t/i/p | bash -s start
  ```
  
  This will check for the latest images and ask for missing dependencies.
  
  To stop Zalenium when you are done testing, you can.

  ```sh
  curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dosel/t/i/p | bash -s stop
  ```

* After getting the message `Zalenium in docker started!`, head to [http://localhost:4444/grid/console](http://localhost:4444/grid/console).

* If you want to see the browsers while the test is running, you can access the container with VNC through 
[http://localhost:4444/grid/admin/live](http://localhost:4444/grid/admin/live).
