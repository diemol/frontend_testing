## WebDriver examples in JavaScript with Mocha and Chai running in parallel

These examples are running a few simple tests written in JavaScript using the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test
framework. The tests are executed in parallel with [Mocha-Parallel-Tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha-parallel-tests).

### Environment Setup

1. Project Dependencies
    * Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    * Or Install Node.js with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
    ```sh
    brew install node
    ```
2. Sauce Credentials
    * In the terminal export your Sauce Labs Credentials as environmental variables:
    ```sh
    export SAUCE_USERNAME=<your Sauce Labs username>
    export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<your Sauce Labs access key>
    ```

### Steps to run it:

1. Clone the repo:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/diemol/frontend_testing
    cd frontend_testing
    ```
1. Change directory to:

    ```sh
    cd running-in-parallel/js-mocha-chai/<initial/complete>
    ```
1. Install Node dependencies (Selenium WebDriver, Mocha, Chai, and Mocha-Parallel-Tests):

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
1. Execute the code:

	```sh
	npm test
	```

Afterwards you can check the executed test in the [Sauce Labs Dashboard](https://saucelabs.com/beta/dashboard/)

### How is parallelism working in these examples?


The tests are executed in several threads using the mocha-parallel-tests. This `npm` package grabs every JS file in
the `test` folder and runs it in its own thread. In addition, you can change the `--max-parallel` value in the
package.json file to increase the number of threads if needed.

When multiple browsers are used, the project is wrapped in several Grunt tasks and then executed in parallel.
